# Complete this program so that it produces the expected output:

class Book
  attr_reader :title, :author
  
  def initialize(author, title)
    @author = author
    @title = title
  end

  def to_s
    %("#{title}", by #{author})
  end
end

puts %(The author of "#{book.title}" is #{book.author}.)
puts %(book = #{book}.)
