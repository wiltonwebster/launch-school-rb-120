# Nobility

=begin
Now that we have a Walkable module, we are given a new challenge. Apparently 
some of our users are nobility, and the regular way of walking simply isn't good
enough. Nobility need to strut.

We need a new class Noble that shows the title and name when walk is called:

byron = Noble.new("Byron", "Lord")
byron.walk
# => "Lord Byron struts forward"

We must have access to both name and title because they are needed for other 
purposes that we aren't showing here.

byron.name
=> "Byron"
byron.title
=> "Lord"
=end

module Walkable
  def walk
    "#{self} #{self.gait} forward."
  end
end

class Person
  include Walkable

  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  def to_s
    name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Noble < Person
  attr_reader :title
  
  def initialize(name, title)
    super(name)
    @title = title
  end
  
  def to_s
    "#{title} #{name}"
  end
  
  private
  
  def gait
    "struts"
  end
end

byron = Noble.new("Byron", "Lord")
p byron.walk
# => "Lord Byron struts forward"

p byron.name
# => "Byron"
p byron.title
# => "Lord"
