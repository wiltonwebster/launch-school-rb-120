=begin 
Given this class, one problem is that we need to keep track of different breeds 
of dogs, since they have slightly different behaviors. For example, bulldogs 
can't swim, but all other dogs can.

Create a sub-class from Dog called Bulldog overriding the swim method to return
"can't swim!"

class Dog
  def speak
    'bark!'
  end

  def swim
    'swimming!'
  end
end

class Bulldog < Dog
  def swim
    "can't swim!"
  end
end

teddy = Dog.new
puts teddy.speak           # => "bark!"
puts teddy.swim           # => "swimming!"

bully = Bulldog.new
puts bully.speak
