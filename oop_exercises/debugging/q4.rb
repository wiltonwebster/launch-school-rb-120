# Employee Management

# We have written some code for a simple employee management system. Each 
# employee must have a unique serial number. However, when we are testing our 
# program, an exception is raised. Fix the code so that the program works as 
# expected without error.

=begin
The attribute reader method for Employee serial_number is private, but it should
be protected. The Employee == method requires the ability to compare one serial
number to another, which isn't possible if the getter method is private. Each 
object will be able to see its own serial number, but it won't be able to see
another object's number for comparison. To fix this, we can add the protected
keyword and move the serial number getter from the private section into the 
protected section.
